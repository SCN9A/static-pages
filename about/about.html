  <h3 id="mission">Mission</h3>
  <div class="col s12">
    <p>The mission of ASA Stats is to become the primary <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X17301344" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read article 'The source of information in prices and investment-price sensitivity'">source of price information</a> for every ASA on the Algorand blockchain.<br>
    <br></p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="void">Identifying the Void</h3>
  <div class="col s12">
    <p>As minting and trading Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) became increasingly seamless, the surge in diverse assets within the Algorand blockchain ecosystem posed a challenge for users trying to ascertain the true value of their holdings. Therefore, ASA Stats aims to offer distinct valuations for each ASA, reflecting current market conditions.<br>
